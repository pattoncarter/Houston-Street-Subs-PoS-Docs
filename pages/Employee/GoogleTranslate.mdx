# Functionality
The GoogleTranslate.js file serves to provide the code functionality for implementing the Google Translate script into the desired webpage. The code works by sourcing 
the Google Translate script from a third party (Google), and running it along with a dropdown display for selecting the language. The file exports itself out to be imported
in the desired webpage as an import.
