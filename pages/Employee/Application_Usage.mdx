# Ordering
Ordering can be done using the checkout screen. To checkout a customer order, you can press the desired menu item on the screen to aggregate said item to the dynamic cart featured on the page. You will be redirected to a designated cart page which will lead you to adding it to the cart. After the complete order is accounted for, you can then checkout the order by pressing the button on the cart page and the total will be calculated. If you forgot something, you can use the order more button to return to the ordering menu. You can then revisit the cart and click checkout to complete your order!
