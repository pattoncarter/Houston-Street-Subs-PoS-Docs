# Navigation
Navigation tools and objects are placed at the very bottom level inside of the "footer" argument gathered from the app/globals.css file.
This navigation allows the user to transition between GUI's as a manager would have the priority to do.

# Functionality
Buttons, Text-Box Input Prompts and dropdown menus are paired together near the top of the GUI, allowing for easy access to any of the Reports
designed in an earlier stage, in this case the Sales, Excess, X, and Z Reports. The drop-down bar functions nearly spotlessly and allows the
user to select whether they wish to generate an X report or Z report before pushing the corresponding button. The other buttons have text boxes
paired with them, meant to be dates input by the user to generate the Sales and Excess reports respectively. However, due to our database 
not containing valid unique identifiers for every table, this was a function we ahd to leave on the backburner.

# Weather
A weather API is also implemented, showing in real time the temperature in College STation, where our particular Houston Stree Subs is located.
The temperature is initially received in Kelvin, but after some real-time calculations this is corrected into Farenheit and then presented to the Manager
along with an icon ro display the sky's nature and the current humidity.
